you will write about what you learned over the course of this project. Try and frame this around the "six things" (variables, functions, conditionals, arrays, loops, objects). You can mention the revisions you made as part of this Wrap-Up Project. You can talk about things you know now that you didn't the first time you did these projects. Your reflections will be evaluated on thoughtfulness, thoroughness, and congruency with the evidence of your work (If, for instance, you say you learned a lot about arrays in a given project, but you don't effectively use arrays in the project, that would be incongruent).
